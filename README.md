# What is Dexter?
- Dexter is a simple search algorithm built on the Fibonnaci divide and conquer algorithm.

# Why?
- I am building Dexter to learn more about how search algorithms work and more about the fibonacci sequence and what it can do. I hope to add some cool features like ML in the future.

# What is the Fibonnaci Sequence/Algorith?
- The Fibonnaci Sequence was invented by Italian mathmatician Leonardo Pisano, in 1202. Pisano discovered it as a result of a question about rabbit breeding that was proposed in the Liber Abaci, which was a book written by himself. He figured that if you have a defined number, such as 1, and add the two numbers before it in the sequence, you'll get the next number is the sequence.

# How does the actual search algorithm work?
- The Fibonnaci Search works with 3 Fibonnaci numbers at a time. It takes your current Fib Number, and uses that to calculate the previous fib number, and the 2nd previous fib number. It then uses these to identify elements in the array that share elements. 

# Why Fibonnaci?
- While I want to say its because it uses less CPU and RAM because its temporary mathmatical equatiosns or something.. its actually just because I like a math a lot.
